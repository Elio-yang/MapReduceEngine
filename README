MapReduce Engine
======================
 1. Structure
    the src/ directory includes
        load/   :  a tool for load codes as a plugin
        main/   :  sequential & distributed mapreduce main programs with testing scripts
        mr/     :  the real implementation of master & worker
        mrapps/ :  user specified map & reduce function, can be load as plugin
 2. How to use?
    a. simple way
        using "./test-mr.sh"
        this will test all the map&reduce functions in mrapps/
        see mrapps/ for more details of what the tests are about
    b. personal way
        if you want to build this in a personal approach, follow the steps:
            1. build a plugin for your mapreduce engine like (see test-mr.sh for more):
                cd src/main
                go build -race -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go
            2. build master and worker
                <in one window>     go run -race mrcoordinator.go pg-*.txt
                <in another window> go run -race mrworker.go wc.so
            3. see the outputs in mr-out*, you may want to delete all these files before a new testing
 3. How to understand?
    a.  read the paper <https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/mapreduce.pdf>
    b.  know something about go programming <https://learnku.com/docs/gobyexample/2020>
    c.  see the struct type in coordinator.go , follow these data structures
    d.  debug this program and add more log information for your understanding
    e.  read the annotation, maybe I have solved your problem
